# Start Using Legacy Firefox WebDriver

The 'start using selenium webdriver' code that covers legacy firefox approaches.

This should really be 'stop' using legacy firefox webdriver since you really want to be as up to date with WebDriver as you can.

But I'll use this repo for code that shows how to use the older versions if required.

I'm pulling the code out of my Start using Selenium Web Driver project because that project is designed for beginners and cluttering it with legacy information seems more likely to confuse, than to help.
